# Discovery Server
After flashing the SD-Card and booting up the Turtlebot 4, the robot will be in Access Point-mode. 

## Connecting to Turtlebot 
1. Connect to the TurtleBots WiFi, SSID is "TurtleBot4".

2. Once connected to the WiFi, open up a terminal and write:  
```ssh ubuntu@10.42.0.1```  

3. You're now connected to the on-board Raspberry Pi 4B. Run the TurtleBot setup by writing:  
```turtlebot4-setup```  
This will bring up a setup screen where you can add the credentials for the network you wish the TurtleBot to connect to.

## Configuring turtlebot4-setup
Now, you need to set up the TurtleBot to use Discovery Server. Once you have run the ```turtlebot4-setup``` command, you will be greeted by the following screen.

### WiFi Setup
Navigate back to the main setup menu (don't forget to save the settings) and go to WiFi-settings.  
`Wi-Fi Mode` should be set as `client`  
`SSID` is the name of the network you want to connect to  
`Password` is the WiFi password  
`Band` is recommended to be set to `5GHz`  
`IP Adress` can remain empty  
`DHCP` should be set to `True`

#### **Don't forget to hit Save!**

You should now go back to the main menu again, hit `Apply Settings` and the TurtleBot will reboot and try to connect to the WiFi you've set it up for. 

## On PC
Your PC should run `Ubuntu 22.04`. If you haven't completed the setup of ROS2, go to [Base-Setup](Base-Setup.md) and complete the steps first.  

Make sure that you have `Git` installed, otherwise, the script supplied will not work properly. Check if git installed by running `git --version` in terminal. If you need to install git, run `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt install git`.

Run `wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_setup/humble/turtlebot4_discovery/configure_discovery.sh | bash <(cat) </dev/tty` and follow the on-screen instructions. 

1. Initial prompt

2. Enter IP-adress found on the Turtlebot's screen, hit enter until the `domain id` which should be a unique identifier (important for running more than one robot)

3. Source your bash by running `~/.bashrc`

4. Test that everything has been successfully set up by running `ip route`

5. Run `ros2 daemon stop; ros2 daemon start` then run `ros2 topic list` and you should get a long list of topics. Sometimes, you'll need to run it twice before all topics show up.
